AGS Steam stub plugin

This is a replacement for the AGSteam plugin by monkey_05_06 that can be found
here: http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/forums/index.php?topic=44712.0

It replicates its functionality and provides basic in-memory storage of state,
so games that require this plugin should run without the Steam client.
As of the current release, statistics and achievements are also written to
disk and loaded back on startup. The location of the state database is
$SAVEGAMEDIR$/agsteam.db, which will normally translate to
<Home Directory>/.local/share/ags/<Game Name>/agsteam.db

Note that this plugin was written primarily to allow playing Heroine's Quest
on Linux, for which no official release is available (yet?). Other platforms
and games are untested.
The Windows version of Heroine's Quest can be downloaded for free on Steam:

Please do not use the plugin to circumvent Steam DRM and play games you
haven't paid for! Every developer has invested countless hours into providing
you with entertainment, you should acknowledge that and support them by buying
their games legally.

The author has not signed an NDA with Valve Software, Inc. and has not had
access to any material concerning the Steam API. This software was originally
developed by extracting the string contents of AGSteam.dll, but all the
required information can also be obtained from the aforementioned thread on
adventuregamestudio.co.uk. No machine code was analyzed or reverse engineered.

To compile the plugin, a copy of agsplugin.h is needed, along with a C++
compiler, (GNU) make and associated tools. Please download the latest version
of agsplugin.h from github and copy it into the same directory as agsteam.cpp
and Makefile. Then run make, which should produce libagsteam.so. This is the
plugin. If you copy it into a game folder, ags should find and load it
automatically, just like it would do with AGSteam.dll on Windows.

Specific instructions for Debian and Ubuntu (untested):
$ sudo apt-get install g++ libc6-dev git make wget
$ git clone https://github.com/onitake/agsteamstub.git
$ cd agsteam
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adventuregamestudio/ags/master/Engine/plugin/agsplugin.h
$ make
$ cp libagsteam.so <your_game_directory>
$ cd <your_game_directory>
$ ags
