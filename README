AGS Steam stub plugin

This is a replacement for the AGSteam plugin by monkey_05_06 that can
be found here:
http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/forums/index.php?topic=44712.0

It replicates its functionality and provides basic in-memory storage
of state, so games that require this plugin should run without the
Steam client.

Note that this plugin was written exclusively to allow playing
Heroine's Quest on Linux, for which no official release is available
at the time of writing.
Heroine's Quest is a game that can be downloaded freely from Steam:
